Simulation results. 
\textbf{A}: A $100 \times 100$ covariance matrix without a low-dimensional structure, a sample covariance with n=2000, distributions of true and sample correlation coefficients, eigenspectra of true and sample covariances.
\textbf{B}: A similar covariance matrix with 8 factors.
\textbf{C}: A similar covariance matrix with sparse inverse. 
\textbf{D}: A similar covariance matrix with sparse + low-rank inverse with 3 latent units.
\textbf{E}: Risk convergence rates
