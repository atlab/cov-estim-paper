As described in \cite{Cotton:2013}



\subsection*{List of things to mention}

\begin{itemize}
\item How do we determine the mixing proportions $\lambda$ etc. Evaluation of likelihood/loss function on held-out validation set...

\item Define $L_1$ norm used for sparsification. Only off-diagonals are used?

\end{itemize}
